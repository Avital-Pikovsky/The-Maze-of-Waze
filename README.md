# The-Maze-of-Waze
Third task in OOP course.

This repository contains a graph based game.

The game takes place on a graph, containing nodes and edges, and each edge has a 'cost', meaning that some edges takes more time to cross then others.

You can choose from 24 levels of play, each has a different amount of robots and fruits.

The main goal is to control the robots and by moving them, eating as many fruits as you can.

There are two game modes available, manual mode and auto mode.

In the manual mode you have full control of placing the robots and moving them, you can do it by clicking on the screen.

In the auto mode you will watch the game plays automatically, moving the robots with graph algorithms functions.

This repository is based on previous repository :[Weigthted-Directed-Graph](https://github.com/Avital-Pikovsky/Weigthted-Directed-Graph).
